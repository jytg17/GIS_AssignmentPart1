	abstract = {Choropleth maps are the most widely used map type for mapping rates, such as those involving disease, crime, and socioeconomic indicators. The essential step of choosing a geographic unit to map is often made in an ad hoc manner. Among the desirable characteristics of choropleth mapping units are high degree of resolution, homogeneity of population size, homogeneity of land area, observation of minimum population thresholds and land area thresholds, temporal stability and currency, compactness of shape, audience familiarity, data availability, and the functional relevance of the unit to the phenomena mapped. Because of the uneven distribution of human populations, no single geographic unit can meet all of these characteristics in practice, and a well designed choropleth map necessarily involves some compromise. We present guidelines for choosing geographic units that take into account the above criteria, considering 12 geographic units ranging from census blocks to states. Even allowing for differences in scale and purpose, some units confer clear advantages over others.},

	abstract = {Identifying changes in the spatial structure of cities is a prerequisite for the development and validation of adequate planning strategies. Nevertheless, current methods of measurement are becoming ever more challenged by the highly diverse and intertwined ways of how people actually make use of urban space. Here, we propose a new quantitative measure for the centrality of locations, taking into account not only the numbers of people attracted to different locations, but also the diversity of the activities they are engaged in. This ‘centrality index’ allows for the identification of functional urban centres and for a systematic tracking of their relative importance over time, thus contributing to our understanding of polycentricity. We demonstrate the proposed index using travel survey data in Singapore for different years between 1997 and 2012. It is shown that, on the one hand, the city-state has been developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form that compares rather closely with the official urban development plan. On the other hand, however, the downtown core has strongly gained in its importance, and this can be partly attributed to the recent extension of the public transit system.},

It is argued that an important part of this body of literature has defined the meaning of home mostly for traditional households living in single-family detached houses although it is shown that there is a growing concern among recent studies for investigating nontraditional populations and settings. Furthermore, it is argued that the role of material aspects of housing and of societal forces in the production and reproduction of the meaning of home has been neglected. Exemplary studies from other areas of housing research which emphasize these macro/societal-forces are presented. From this critical review, the paper concludes that more integrative theoretical perspectives on environmental meaning need to be adopted to investigate home environments.},

And yet there exists a vast amount of primary material available on this topic that has been collected by anthropologists whose principal interests lie not in housing per se,but whose broad ethnographic nets have yielded a rich catch of housing data nevertheless (see Guerry, 1975; Hogbin, 1939; Jackson, 1977; Lessa, 1966; Lewis, 1965). Similarly, the small and yet burgeoning field of women’s studies also yields, as a by-product, perhaps the most interesting and detailed research on the use of the house conducted by researchers whose principal focus again is not on housing (see Giele \& Smock, 1977; Jeffrey, 1979; Matthiasson, 1974; Patai, 1967; Reiter, 1975).},

It focuses on the claims made by Sassen that the processes of economic change in such cities are leading to a growing polarisation of the occupational and income structures whereby there is absolute growth at both the top and bottom ends of the distribution and a decline in the middle of the distribution. It is argued that while these claims may hold true for New York and Los Angeles, possibly because of their very high levels of immigration and the creation of large numbers of low skilled and low paid jobs, her attempt to extend the thesis to all global cities is problematic. In other cities professionalisaton appears to be dominant. Evidence on occupational change in Randstad Holland is presented to support this argument.},
